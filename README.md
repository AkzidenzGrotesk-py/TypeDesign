# TypeDesign
A collection of my typefaces (and other designs).

## .ttf
_All of my fonts as TrueType format._
- **Affrimy Regular:** A very janky sans-serif font.
- **Affrimy Serif:** It has serif in the name, but it's just a sans-serif font with a lot of stroke contrast.
- **LS-OutsideAdvice:** Based on some painted type, only uppercase letters.
- **Kin's Railroad Regular:** My handwriting! I think this font turned out pretty good.
- **Eiustas Sans:** A pretty decent raster font.
- **SiziC:** Font meant for use with the Python Console Engine... but the console doesn't support it.
